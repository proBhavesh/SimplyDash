# Realtime API Interruption Implementation Fix

## Issue Description
We encountered persistent `invalid_request_error` messages during WebSocket interruption handling. The key error was:

```
invalid_request_error: Audio content of 9800ms is already shorter than 235200ms
```

This error occurred both during interruptions and normal operation, indicating we were sending `response.cancel` messages even when not actively interrupting.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, we identified that the `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` handler was unconditionally sending a `response.cancel` event without first checking if there was an active response to cancel.

## Solution Implementation
We modified two key areas to resolve this issue:

1. **Conditional Response Cancellation**
In `eventHandlers.ts`, we added a check for an active response before sending the cancel event:

```typescript
if (currentResponseIdRef.current && wsRef.current?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  const cancelEvent = {
    type: 'response.cancel'
  };
  wsRef.current.send(JSON.stringify(cancelEvent));
  addRealtimeEvent('client', 'response.cancel');
}
```

2. **Smart Audio Truncation**
In `useRealtimeConnection.ts`, we added validation for the playback offset before attempting truncation:

```typescript
if (playbackOffset > 0 && playbackOffset < 200000) {
  // Only truncate if offset is within reasonable range
  // Proceed with truncation
}
```

## Compliance with Realtime API Best Practices

Our solution aligns with the official Realtime API best practices in several ways:

1. **Proper Interruption Handling**
   - We follow the documented interruption flow: cancel response first, then truncate audio
   - We respect the API's state management by checking for active responses
   - We handle audio truncation in accordance with playback state

2. **Event Sequencing**
   - We maintain proper event order: cancel -> truncate -> cleanup
   - We avoid sending unnecessary events that could conflict with API state

3. **Error Prevention**
   - We validate state before sending commands
   - We check audio lengths and offsets before truncation
   - We prevent invalid operations on non-existent responses

4. **Resource Management**
   - We properly track response IDs and states
   - We clean up resources after interruption
   - We maintain WebSocket connection stability

## Testing and Validation
To verify this fix:

1. Monitor WebSocket traffic for unnecessary `response.cancel` events
2. Verify interruption behavior works correctly
3. Confirm no invalid request errors during normal operation
4. Test edge cases like rapid interruptions

## Monitoring
To ensure ongoing stability:

1. Watch for `invalid_request_error` messages in logs
2. Monitor WebSocket event sequences
3. Track audio truncation operations
4. Log response cancellation events

This implementation now properly respects the Realtime API's state management and event sequencing requirements while preventing invalid operations that could trigger errors.
