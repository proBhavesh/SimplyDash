# vapi.ai Integration Research and Plan

## 1. API Documentation

vapi.ai is a platform for building and managing AI assistants. To integrate with vapi.ai, we need to understand their API endpoints and authentication methods. Here's what we know based on the existing code and general API best practices:

- Base URL: Not explicitly mentioned in the code, but likely to be something like `https://api.vapi.ai/` or similar.
- Authentication: Likely uses bearer token authentication, as seen in the `fetchWithAuth` function in our codebase.

Key endpoints we need to research:

1. List Assistants
2. Create Assistant
3. Delete Assistant
4. Get Assistant Usage
5. Update Assistant
6. Interact with Assistant (for chat functionality)

## 2. Current Integration

Our codebase already has some integration with vapi.ai. Here's what we've identified:

- The `useAssistants` hook in `src/hooks/useAssistants.ts` handles fetching and managing assistants.
- The dashboard page (`src/components/dashboard-page.tsx`) displays assistant information and usage data.
- There are API routes in `pages/api/` that likely act as proxies to vapi.ai endpoints.

## 3. Integration Plan

1. **API Client**:
   - Create a dedicated vapi.ai API client in `src/utils/vapiClient.ts`.
   - Implement methods for each vapi.ai endpoint we need to interact with.
   - Use the existing `fetchWithAuth` function for authenticated requests.

2. **Type Definitions**:
   - Expand the `Assistant` type in `src/types/assistant.ts` to include all relevant fields from vapi.ai.
   - Create types for API responses and request payloads.

3. **Hook Enhancements**:
   - Update `useAssistants` hook to use the new vapi.ai client.
   - Add methods for creating and updating assistants.

4. **UI Components**:
   - Create a new component for interacting with a specific assistant (chat interface).
   - Update the dashboard to include more vapi.ai-specific features.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement specific error handling for vapi.ai API errors.
   - Update the ErrorMessage component to handle vapi.ai-specific error messages.

6. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the vapi.ai client.
   - Update existing tests to mock vapi.ai responses.
   - Create integration tests for vapi.ai interactions.

## 4. Next Steps

1. Obtain official vapi.ai API documentation.
2. Implement the vapi.ai API client.
3. Update type definitions based on the official documentation.
4. Enhance the `useAssistants` hook with new vapi.ai client.
5. Create a basic chat interface component for interacting with assistants.
6. Update the dashboard with any new vapi.ai-specific features.
7. Implement error handling for vapi.ai-specific errors.
8. Write tests for new and updated components.

## 5. Questions to Address

1. What is the rate limiting policy for vapi.ai API?
2. Are there any specific authentication requirements beyond bearer tokens?
3. What is the pricing model for vapi.ai, and how does it affect our usage?
4. Are there any specific data handling or privacy considerations we need to address?

As we progress with the integration, we'll update this document with more specific details and any challenges we encounter.
