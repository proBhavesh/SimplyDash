# Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Core Integrations

## Sprint Goals
- Set up the project structure and development environment
- Implement core integrations (Stripe, Firebase, vapi.ai)
- Establish basic user authentication and subscription handling
- Implement and test key features for assistant management

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [x] Configure environment variables for API keys and secrets
- [x] Implement Stripe webhook for handling subscription events
- [x] Set up Firestore database for storing assistant data
- [x] Create basic Firebase authentication setup
- [x] Implement useAssistants hook for fetching and managing assistants
- [x] Add functionality to calculate and display correct usage data
- [x] Implement monthly usage allowance tracking
- [x] Add feature to unpublish assistants when usage limit is exceeded
- [x] Create unit tests for useAssistants hook
- [x] Set up Jest configuration for running tests

## In Progress
- [ ] Refine Firebase authentication implementation
  - [ ] Implement protected routes for authenticated users
  - [ ] Create user session management
- [ ] Develop main dashboard components
  - [ ] Create layout for displaying assistant information
  - [ ] Implement UI for creating and managing assistants
- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling across the application
  - [ ] Set up centralized logging system for easier debugging

## Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Integrate vapi.ai API calls
  - [ ] Implement functions for creating, updating, and deleting assistants
  - [ ] Set up real-time chat interface with vapi.ai assistants
- [ ] Implement user notification system for approaching usage limits
- [ ] Create additional unit tests for other critical components and hooks
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of the subscription and usage tracking system

## Design Decisions
1. Use Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes
2. Implement Stripe for subscription management
3. Use Firebase for authentication and Firestore for database
4. Integrate vapi.ai for AI assistant functionality
5. Implement a hook-based approach for managing assistants and their data

## Technical Challenges
1. Ensuring secure handling of API keys and secrets
2. Managing state between client and server for real-time updates
3. Handling potential race conditions in subscription status updates
4. Accurately tracking and limiting usage across multiple assistants

## Learnings
- Importance of thorough webhook testing and error logging
- Need for careful management of environment variables across development and production
- Benefit of using Firestore transactions for critical data updates
- Importance of unit testing for complex data processing functions

## Next Sprint Preview
- Implement full CRUD operations for assistants
- Develop advanced chat interface features
- Begin work on analytics and reporting features
- Enhance user experience with real-time updates and notifications
