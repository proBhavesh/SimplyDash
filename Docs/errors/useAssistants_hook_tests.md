# Errors in useAssistants Hook Tests

## Issue
Several tests in the `useAssistants` hook were failing due to mock function issues and incorrect assertions.

## Solution
1. Review and update mock functions for vapi.ai API calls.
2. Adjust test assertions to match the expected behavior of the hook.
3. Ensure that the test environment properly simulates the Firebase authentication state.

## Prevention
- Write tests alongside feature development to catch integration issues early.
- Regularly review and update tests as the application's behavior evolves.
