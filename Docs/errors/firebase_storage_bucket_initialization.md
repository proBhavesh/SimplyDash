# Firebase Storage Bucket Initialization Issue

## Issue
The application was encountering an error when trying to initialize the Firebase Storage bucket. The error message was:
"Bucket name not specified or invalid. Specify a valid bucket name via the storageBucket option when initializing the app, or specify the bucket name explicitly when calling the getBucket() method."

## Root Cause
The Firebase Admin SDK was not properly initializing the Storage bucket due to issues with environment variable loading or configuration in the server environment.

## Solution
1. Updated the `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` file to include more detailed logging of the initialization process.
2. Added a fallback mechanism to use a default bucket name if the environment variable is not set:
   ```typescript
   const storageBucket = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET || `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID}.appspot.com`;
   ```
3. Explicitly set the bucket name when initializing the Firebase Admin SDK:
   ```typescript
   admin.initializeApp({
     credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount as admin.ServiceAccount),
     storageBucket: storageBucket,
   });
   ```
4. Added more error handling and logging around the Storage bucket initialization:
   ```typescript
   try {
     storage = admin.storage();
     const bucket = storage.bucket();
     console.log('Firebase storage bucket initialized successfully:', bucket.name);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Error accessing Firebase storage bucket:', error);
     throw error;
   }
   ```

## Prevention
1. Always ensure that environment variables are properly set and loaded in all environments (development, testing, production).
2. Implement comprehensive logging for initialization processes, especially for critical services like Firebase.
3. Use fallback mechanisms for configuration values to increase robustness.
4. Regularly test the application in different environments to catch initialization issues early.

## Best Practices
1. Keep sensitive configuration (like Firebase credentials) in environment variables and ensure they are properly set in all deployment environments.
2. Implement a robust error handling and logging system to quickly identify and diagnose issues in production.
3. Use TypeScript to catch potential type-related errors early in the development process.
4. Regularly review and update Firebase SDK and other dependencies to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features and bug fixes.
