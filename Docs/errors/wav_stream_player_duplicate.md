Problem : 
Based on the logs and the code provided, it appears that the WavStreamPlayer instance used in useRealtimeConnection is different from the one used in useAudioVisualization. This means that the audio data added in useRealtimeConnection is not being received by the WavStreamPlayer instance in useAudioVisualization, resulting in the output visualization not displaying any data.

Solution:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that both useRealtimeConnection and useAudioVisualization use the same instance of WavStreamPlayer. We can achieve this by moving the initialization of wavStreamPlayerRef to a higher scope in the OpenAIRealtimePrototype component and passing it down to both hooks.
I will update the OpenAIRealtimePrototype.tsx file to initialize wavStreamPlayerRef and pass it as a parameter to both useRealtimeConnection and useAudioVisualization.
