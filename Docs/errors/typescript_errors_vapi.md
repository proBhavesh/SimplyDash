# TypeScript Errors in vapi.ts

## Issue
TypeScript errors were encountered in the `src/lib/vapi.ts` file, specifically related to error handling and type assertions.

## Solution
The team decided not to modify production code at this time. Instead, we will:
1. Document the errors for future reference.
2. Consider adding type assertions or improving error handling in a future sprint.
3. Possibly use TypeScript's `// @ts-ignore` comments temporarily if the errors are blocking test execution.

## Prevention
- Regularly review and update TypeScript definitions, especially for external libraries and APIs.
- Consider implementing stricter TypeScript configurations gradually to catch these issues earlier in the development process.
